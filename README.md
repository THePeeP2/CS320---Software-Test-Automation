# CS320-Software-Test-Automation
## Overview
In this assignment, I will add some of my work to my portfolio. This portfolio is like a collection of my best work that I can show to future employers. I will also think about what I have learned from my projects to help me remember in the future.

## What I Need to Do
For this course, I will add these files to my GitHub portfolio:
1. **Project One**:
    - Contact service files (Contact.java, ContactService.java, ContactTest.java, ContactServiceTest.java),
    - Task service files (Task.java, TaskService.java, TaskTest.java, TaskServiceTest.java),
    - Appointment service files (Appointment.java, AppointmentService.java, AppointmentTest.java, AppointmentServiceTest.java).
3. **Project Two**:
   - Summary and reflections report.

These files show my skills in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. They also show that I can create tests to find errors, analyze different testing methods, and use the right strategies to meet the requirements.

## Reflecting on My Work
### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To make sure my code works well and is safe, I test it a lot. I use unit tests, integration tests, and system tests. I also follow coding rules to avoid mistakes and use tools to find any security issues. Regular code reviews and best practices help too.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To understand what users need, I talk to them, do surveys, and read their feedback. I create user stories to see things from their perspective. Then, I design features based on these needs and keep improving the software with their feedback.

### How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I start by understanding the problem and gathering requirements. I make diagrams to visualize the system. I follow design principles to create easy-to-maintain software. I break down the design into smaller parts with clear responsibilities.
